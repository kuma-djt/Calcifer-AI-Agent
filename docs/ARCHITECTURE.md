# Architecture Rationale

## Separation of Concerns

1. Identity → config  
2. Skills → tools  
3. Memory → user-owned  
4. Runtime → orchestration

## Security Model

- Least privilege  
- Human approvals  
- No silent actions  
- Auditable memory

## DoD Relevance

- Mirrors RMF boundaries  
- Supports explainability  
- Red/blue separation  
- Zero-trust principles
